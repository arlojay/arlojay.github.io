            <!-- <p>I my last big project was working on a platformer game called OnlinePlatformer. I would link it here, but
                it's a closed beta and I don't want leaks just in case I open it again in the future. Although, if you
                want to see my other projects, check out my <a href="https://github.com/arlojay">Github!</a> (Fun fact:
                it's hosting this site)</p>
            <p>You can find the first edition of OnlinePlatformer at <a
                    href="http://platformergame.us">platformergame.us</a> if you want to get a feel for what the game
                felt like.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>My newest project is <a href="https://forum.arlojay.com">FurNet,</a> a forum site designed for furries.
                There's not too much outstanding content or features on the site yet or anything that speaks "furry" in
                particular, but anyone is free to sign up while its in development.</p> -->

        <h3>About My Forums</h3>
        <div id="arlojay-forums"> <a href="https://forum.arlojay.com">My Forums</a> started as an idea, just by the
            name: FurNet. I wanted to create a platform where furries could talk to each other. It initally launched as
            a test app for testing <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> and creating a versatile account
            system. Similar to OnlinePlatformer, it became popular among my friends and I kept developing it. I began to
            flesh out some of the basic forum features found on other sites, such as searching, liking, comments, and
            admin controls. However, during public testing, I found that pretty much everyone I showed it to didn't want
            to associated with or reffered to as a furry and changed the name to "Arlojay Forums". By developing this
            app, I learned how to manage <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> databases, <a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/">MongoDB</a> s3 buckets, and <a
                href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>. </div>

        <h3>About OnlinePlatformer (Abandoned)</h3>
        <div id="platformer-game"> OnlinePlatformer, originally known as Platformer Game, was a small project that
            originally started out with a simple p5.js sketch. You were able to edit and save levels to send to other
            people, but it didn't feel like enough. I wanted to make a more universal network, so I decided to start
            working on a more professional game layout/system. <a href="http://platformergame.us">The game</a> became
            more popular among my friends, and it began to outgrow the platform I was making it on: <a
                href="https://www.construct.net/en/construct-2/download">Construct 2</a>. It was also becoming
            discontinued, so I wanted to move away from deprecated software and migrate to something like <a
                href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> or just vanilla JS. I <i>did</i> have a Unity project for a while,
            but it didn't seem like the right way to make it as the physics system gave me incorrect behavior when
            compared to the original C2 version. Then I decided to move to vanilla JS. It was the most successful
            version, with a planned chat room and whole account system, but I lost motivation after trying to go back to
            edit the code for the editor. It was super spaghetti, and it was also the main part of the website. I
            decided that I should start over with more planning involved; I was going to make a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML diagram.</a> That's where I am right
            now, creating the next generation of OnlinePlatformer. I do not have a planned release date, but I will
            update the website when I finish it, or, at least, the first version of it. </div>
