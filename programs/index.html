                    <p>My longest-standing and most famous project. Built first when I was learning JavaScript, rebuilt
                        when I was experienced enough to make an entire network-sites with account systems.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3><a href="https://forum.arlojay.com">FurNet</a></h3>
                    <p>My newest project focused around providing a space for furries to communicate with each other.
                        Starting with a simple idea, it grew into a small network with twenty or so people.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://hangman.arlojay.repl.co">Hangman</a></h3>
                    <p>A game I made to test my JS skills and see how fast I could make a functioning app. I didn't know
                        about Handlebars at the time, so I mimicked its functionality. Not my best app.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://ns.arlojay.com">Network Simulator</a></h3>
                    <p>Created for fun after a lesson about networking. Not anything super special, but provides a place
                        to experiment with encoding and decoding packets.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Very popular during online and partial in-person school to allow lots of people on different
                        platforms to communicate.</p>

                    <p>Created for an assignment to create a game about investing. Turned out kind of fun to play by
                        yourself to challenge how much stock money you can earn by following the trends.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://wordleinfinite.arlojay.repl.co">Wordle Infinite</a></h3>
                    <p>I created this when Wordle was one of the most popular games, and when people always craved more
                        of it. Including me. So I made this app to help quench that thirst.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://2d-tilemap-game-template.arlojay.repl.co">2D Tilemap Library</a></h3>
                    <p>This web library was created as a module for OnlinePlatformer. Anyone can use it if they want.
                        It's not super special.</p>
